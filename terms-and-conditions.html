However, you may cancel the monthly payments at any time by turning off the 'Auto-Renew' switch located under the relevant Creator’s User Content profile or by contacting LYNQ at support@LYNQ.app. If you cancel your monthly payments you will continue to be permitted to view the Creator's User Content until the end of the existing billing period, after which no further payments will be taken from your payment card and you will no longer be able to view the relevant Creator’s User Content. </p>
                <p>4.4 LYNQ receives the Revenue and holds the Commission on behalf of the relevant Creator, and not on your behalf as a Fan. Once LYNQ has received payment from you as a Fan you have no further liability to the relevant Creator and the Creator shall allow you as a Fan to view the User Content or perform Activities. </p>
                <p>4.5 LYNQ will take payment of the Revenue from the Fan and hold the Commission in LYNQ’s capacity as the agent for the Creator. </p>
                <p>4.6 All payments to view User Content or utilize Activities are final and non-refundable. If LYNQ is alerted that a Fan has sought and received a Refund or Chargeback, LYNQ will take additional actions. Any purchase of the right to view User Content or to use Activities which is subsequently subject to a Refund or Chargeback may result in the User’s account being immediately and permanently excluded from LYNQ. The Refund or Chargeback amount may be removed from the earning Creator's income. The Creator may be alerted to the Fan Refund or Chargeback. </p>
